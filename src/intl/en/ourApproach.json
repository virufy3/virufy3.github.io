      "description": "A crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge that used cough samples and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Their results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. Our models achieve an AUC above 70% across all tasks. This work inspires further investigation of how automatically analyzed respiratory patterns could be used as pre-screening signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis.",

The changes range from coarse, clearly audible changes, to minute changes -- what we call \"micro\" signatures, that are not audible to the untrained listener, but are nevertheless present.\"",

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",
    "missionCategory": "Virufy Mission & Vision",
    "nonprofitQ": "Is Virufy a nonprofit?",
    "nonprofitA": "Virufy is a registered California nonprofit public benefit corporation. However, our official 501(c)(3) status approval could take until mid 2021 as the IRS is backlogged due to COVID-19.",
    "postVaccineQ": "What are the plans for Virufy after the COVID-19 vaccine?",
    "postVaccineA": "We anticipate that low-income countries will not have the financial resources and medical infrastructure to vaccinate their population and that rapid, equitable COVID-19 testing will still be important to control the pandemic, especially in those countries.",
    "postControlQ": "What are the plans for Virufy after COVID-19 is under control?",
    "postControlA": "Virufy aims to bring an end to the spread of various communicable diseases through widespread, smartphone-based testing which can be used whenever a community feels at risk of virus spread. We anticipate that the same artificial intelligence technology can be adapted to detect other coronaviruses, including the common cold and influenza.",
    "detectionCategory": "Detection",
    "distinguishableQ": "How might COVID-19 coughs be distinguishable?",
    "distinguishableA": "Similar to all other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs that is distinct from other respiratory infections that produce a wet cough. Consequently, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU[8], MIT[11], and Cambridge[7]. For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7]. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy[8].",
    "diagnosisQ": "How will Virufy's AI Algorithm predict a COVID-19 diagnosis?",
    "diagnosisA": "Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.",
    "performanceQ": "Will the performance of the AI model in different smartphones remain unaffected?",
    "performanceA": "Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions in the app that explain how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of scenarios if needed.",
    "privacyCategory": "Tech & Data Privacy",
    "dataStorageQ": "How will Virufy securely store my data?",
    "dataStorageA": "We use JotForm and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for research study data collection. JotForm and AWS store the data in a secure application with restricted access and controls. Your data will be stored with JotForm or AWS until it is downloaded by us. We will store the data in a database with restricted access. If you would like more information about how Jotform and AWS store your data, please visit their respective privacy policies at https://www.jotform.com/privacy/ and https://aws.amazon.com/en/privacy/. If you would like to learn more please refer to the Virufy privacy policy.",
    "privacyThreatsQ": "Is my privacy ever at risk of being exposed when I donate my cough to Virufy?",
    "privacyThreatsA": "Our strong legal and information security teams have developed a DPIA to address potential risks and threats for your privacy. We will store your personal data in a form that permits us to identify you for a maximum of 4 (four) months in a secure database with restricted access. After 4 (four) months, we will strip all information of your personal details (e.g., your name and contact information) and aggregate this with the information of others, so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual. For the avoidance of doubt, what we will retain long-term is anonymized biometric and health data, such as cough recordings, for the purpose of future research into viruses and other medical conditions. If you would like to learn more please refer to the Virufy privacy policy.",
    "privacyPolicyQ": "Does Virufy have a privacy policy and cookie policy?",
    "privacyPolicyA": "Virufy takes your privacy seriously and our legal team has prepared a detailed privacy policy and cookie policy to protect the personal information you share with us through use of our website, participation in our cough donation study, contacting us, and volunteer applications.",
    "thirdPartiesQ": "Will my data be shared with third parties?",
    "thirdPartiesA": "If you opt-in to share your contact information (e.g., email and phone number) with us, we will not distribute any of this identifiable information to any third party, even for research purposes, without your explicit consent. However, we may share your anonymized information, such as your cough sounds, with third parties in order to accelerate global research efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and other future spreads of disease. More details can be found in our privacy policy and the data collection study consent form.",
    "validTechnologyQ": "Has the technology been validated yet?",
    "validTechnologyA": "Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19. We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. More details can be found on our research page. You may also read about our novel findings in our research paper.",
    "financeCategory": "Financial",
    "financialContributionQ": "Do I need to make a financial contribution if I'm donating my cough?",
    "financialContributionA": "No.",
    "appCostQ": "Will users have to pay to use the app?",
    "appCostA": "As a not-for-profit organization our intention is to make the app free for everyone, especially in low-income countries. However, we may need to charge a nominal fee to support our operations in case we are not able to raise enough funds.",
    "generalCategory": "General",
    "moreQuestionsQ": "What if I have more questions?",
    "moreQuestionsA": "More details can be found in our full privacy policy, cookie policy and consent form which is embedded in the data collection app. For questions related to the data collection study, please email us at study@virufy.org.
