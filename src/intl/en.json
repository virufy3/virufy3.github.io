Consequently, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU[8], MIT, and Cambridge. For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7]. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy.",
      "aiQ": "How will Virufy’s AI algorithm predict a COVID-19 diagnosis? ",
      "aiA": "Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 detection model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences."

      "aboutAI": "About Artificial Intelligence Algorithm",
      "aboutAI.whyQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
      "aboutAI.whyA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detecable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example,research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high acurracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.",
      "aboutAI.howWillQ": "How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?",
      "aboutAI.howWillA": "Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.",
      "aboutAI.howDoesQ": "How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?",
      "aboutAI.howDoesA": "By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster.\n\nMeanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check up or test for COVID.",
      "aboutAI.howDoYouQ": "How do you measure our percentage of effectiveness, and is this measured in clinical studies?",

      "aboutAI.whatWasA": "The process is slow and cumbersome when collecting from hospitals, requiring clinical study forms and IRB approvals. With supervision from Stanford medical advisors, we went through this process for two hospitals in South Asia and are currently in discussions with hospitals in South America and Africa.\nFor collecting directly from users, we spent significant efforts with pro bono expert lawyers to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, including LGPD.\nAs described in our <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>research paper</a>, some of the difficulties we found in processing data included excessive background noises and incorrect cough recordings submitted by users, which required the AI developers to manually clean the audio samples before training AI models.",
      "aboutAI.hasTecnologyQ": "Has the technology been validated yet?",
      "aboutAI.hasTecnologyA": "Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19. We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. As outlined in our research paper, we have independently shown that the COVID cough signature generalizes across continents and between clinical and crowdsourced datasets.\n\nWe have already done IRB-approved clinical studies in hospitals in two countries and are currently seeking approvals in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for clinical studies through private hospital executive and top-level governmental connections.",
      "aboutAI.canAsymptomaticQ": "Can asymptomatic cases be detected?",

      "aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansQ": "What are your plans for Virufy after the COVID-19 vaccine?",
      "aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansA": "We anticipate that low-income countries will not have the financial resources and medical infrastructure to vaccinate their population and that rapid, equitable COVID-19 testing will still be important to control the pandemic, especially in those countries. Additionally, from our discussions with senior vaccine industry experts, it is unclear how effective the new COVID-19 vaccines will be in the long-term and also fear that COVID will remain a seasonal disease similar to other coronaviruses such as the common cold and flu.",
      "aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansControlQ": "What are your plans for Virufy after COVID-19 is under control?",
      "aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansControlA": "Virufy aims to bring an end to the spread of various communicable diseases in low-income countries through widespread, smartphone-based testing which can be used whenever a community feels at risk of virus spread.
