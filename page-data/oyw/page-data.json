For example,research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high acurracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","index.faq.aiQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","index.faq.aiA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","nav.ourApproach":"Our Approach","nav.dashboard":"Dashboard","nav.ourData":"Our Data","nav.our-org":"Our Org","nav.inTheNews":"In the News","nav.getInvolved":"GET INVOLVED","nav.techBehind":"The Technology Behind","nav.openData":"Open Data","nav.faqs":"FAQs","nav.ourVision":"Our Vision","nav.ourSupporters":"Our Supporters","nav.ourTeam":"Our People","news.headers.header":"Virufy as seen in the news","news.headers.filter":"Filter News by Country","news.news.section2.date":"February 2021","news.news.section2.title":"Esta app busca diagnosticar Covid-19 con sólo toser frente al teléfono","news.news.section2.name":"Forbes","news.news.section2.city":" ","news.news.section2.country":" ","news.news.section2.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section3.date":"January 2021","news.news.section3.title":"COVID-19: Aplicativo Virufy puede diagnosticar el virus mediante el análisis de la tos","news.news.section3.name":"MSN","news.news.section3.city":" ","news.news.section3.country":" ","news.news.section3.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section4.date":"October 2020","news.news.section4.title":"VIRUFY: plataforma que permite detectar si estamos contagiados con COVID-19","news.news.section4.name":"Expreso","news.news.section4.city":"Lima, ","news.news.section4.country":"Peru","news.news.section4.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section5.date":"May 2020","news.news.section5.title":"One Young World Japan Ambassador Targets COVID-19 Using A.I.","news.news.section5.name":"One Young World","news.news.section5.city":"Tokyo, ","news.news.section5.country":"Japan","news.news.section5.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section6.date":"2020","news.news.section6.title":"North American Ambassadors on the Frontlines of the COVID-19 Response","news.news.section6.name":"One Young World","news.news.section6.city":" ","news.news.section6.country":" ","news.news.section6.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section7.date":"July 2020","news.news.section7.title":"Ambassadors of the Month July","news.news.section7.name":"One Young World","news.news.section7.city":" ","news.news.section7.country":" ","news.news.section7.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section8.date":"July 2020","news.news.section8.title":"Thousands attend OYW's global digital events in July: A recap of what you've missed","news.news.section8.name":"One Young World","news.news.section8.city":" ","news.news.section8.country":" ","news.news.section8.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section9.date":"2020","news.news.section9.title":"One Young World Tokyo 2020 Caucus","news.news.section9.name":"One Young World","news.news.section9.city":" ","news.news.section9.country":" ","news.news.section9.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section10.date":"2020","news.news.section10.title":"Virufy Presentation to One Young World Tokyo 2020 Cacus","news.news.section10.name":"One Young World","news.news.section10.city":"Tokyo, ","news.news.section10.country":"Japan","news.news.section10.readMoreLink":"Watch Now","news.news.section11.date":"2020","news.news.section11.title":"Sounds of COVID-19 Workshop","news.news.section11.name":"One Young World","news.news.section11.city":" ","news.news.section11.country":" ","news.news.section11.readMoreLink":"Read more...","ourApproach.topFold.diagnoseDisease":"AI to freely and quickly identify diseases","ourApproach.topFold.acrossNations":"All people across all nations should have fast, affordable access to healthcare.","ourApproach.topFold.usingTechnology":"So we’re using technology to do this.

Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesQ":"How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesA":"By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster. Meanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check-up or test for COVID.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouQ":"How do you measure our percentage of effectiveness, and is this measured in clinical studies?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouA":"Please see <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>https://virufy.org/paper</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/research.html'>https://virufy.org/research.html</a>  for details about our research.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneQ":"Are smartphone microphones reliable enough to be used for detection?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneA":"Yes, the results from 3500 people from 20 countries with many different smartphones show that microphones are indeed able to capture COVID-19 signatures.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceQ":"Will the performance of the AI model in different environments remain unaffected?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceA":"Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions on the app on how to record their cough.
