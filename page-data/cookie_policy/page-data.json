We anticipate that the same artificial intelligence technology can be adapted to detect other coronaviruses, including the common cold and influenza.","ourApproach.faq.detectionCategory":"Technology","ourApproach.faq.distinguishableQ":"Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?","ourApproach.faq.distinguishableA":"Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs that is distinct from other respiratory infections that produce a wet cough. Consequently, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU[8], MIT, and Cambridge. For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7]. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy.","ourApproach.faq.diagnosisQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","ourApproach.faq.diagnosisA":"Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","ourApproach.faq.performanceQ":"Will the performance of the AI model in different smartphones remain unaffected?","ourApproach.faq.performanceA":"Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions in the app that explain how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of scenarios if needed.","ourApproach.faq.privacyCategory":"Data Privacy","ourApproach.faq.dataStorageQ":"How will Virufy securely store my data?","ourApproach.faq.dataStorageA":"We use JotForm and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for research study data collection. JotForm and AWS store the data in a secure application with restricted access and controls. Your data will be stored with JotForm or AWS until it is downloaded by us.

We will store your personal data in a form that permits us to identify you for a maximum of 4 (four) months in a secure database with restricted access. After 4 (four) months, we will strip all information of your personal details (e.g., your name and contact information) and aggregate this with the information of others, so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual. For the avoidance of doubt, what we will retain long-term is anonymized biometric and health data, such as cough recordings, for the purpose of future research into viruses and other medical conditions. If you would like to learn more please refer to the Virufy privacy policy.","ourApproach.faq.privacyPolicyQ":"Does Virufy have a privacy policy and cookie policy?","ourApproach.faq.privacyPolicyA":"Virufy takes your privacy seriously and our legal team has prepared a detailed privacy policy and cookie policy to protect the personal information you share with us through use of our website, participation in our cough donation study, contacting us, and volunteer applications.","ourApproach.faq.thirdPartiesQ":"Will my data be shared with third parties?","ourApproach.faq.thirdPartiesA":"If you opt-in to share your contact information (e.g., email and phone number) with us, we will not distribute any of this identifiable information to any third party, even for research purposes, without your explicit consent. However, we may share your anonymized information, such as your cough sounds, with third parties in order to accelerate global research efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and other future spreads of disease. More details can be found in our privacy policy and the data collection study consent form.","ourApproach.faq.validTechnologyQ":"Has the technology been validated yet?","ourApproach.faq.validTechnologyA":"Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19.
