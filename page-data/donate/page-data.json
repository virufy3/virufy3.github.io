However, our official 501(c)(3) status approval could take until mid 2021 as the IRS is backlogged due to COVID-19.","ourApproach.faq.postVaccineQ":"What are the plans for Virufy after the COVID-19 vaccine?","ourApproach.faq.postVaccineA":"We anticipate that low-income countries will not have the financial resources and medical infrastructure to vaccinate their population and that rapid, equitable COVID-19 testing will still be important to control the pandemic, especially in those countries.","ourApproach.faq.postControlQ":"What are the plans for Virufy after COVID-19 is under control?","ourApproach.faq.postControlA":"Virufy aims to bring an end to the spread of various communicable diseases through widespread, smartphone-based testing which can be used whenever a community feels at risk of virus spread. We anticipate that the same artificial intelligence technology can be adapted to detect other coronaviruses, including the common cold and influenza.","ourApproach.faq.detectionCategory":"Technology","ourApproach.faq.distinguishableQ":"Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?","ourApproach.faq.distinguishableA":"Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 creates a unique respiratory signature in the throat and lungs that is distinct from other respiratory infections that produce a wet cough. Consequently, it has been suggested that cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU[8], MIT, and Cambridge. For example, a crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy (AUC = 0.7)[7]. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained a model to diagnose COVID-19 with a 89.1% accuracy.","ourApproach.faq.diagnosisQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","ourApproach.faq.diagnosisA":"Based on this past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","ourApproach.faq.performanceQ":"Will the performance of the AI model in different smartphones remain unaffected?","ourApproach.faq.performanceA":"Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions in the app that explain how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of scenarios if needed.","ourApproach.faq.privacyCategory":"Data Privacy","ourApproach.faq.dataStorageQ":"How will Virufy securely store my data?","ourApproach.faq.dataStorageA":"We use JotForm and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for research study data collection.
