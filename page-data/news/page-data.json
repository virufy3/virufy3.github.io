He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital. The original team of Virufy, beginning with Stanford graduate AI students, expanded to volunteers from universities around the world.\n\nAs a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World Japan</a> ambassador who has travelled to over a dozen countries, Amil understands the global perspective and how a smartphone-based solution can be used by people all over the world.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatWillQ":"What will your organization do?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatWillA":"Virufy aims to build the world’s largest dataset of COVID cough sounds by generating a movement where millions of people collectively contribute their data to fight our common enemy, COVID. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit startup free of institutional red tape and with a diverse team across 20 countries, we are well positioned to make this happen.\n\nOnce approved by local public health authorities, smartphone app(s) for rapid, no-cost COVID testing will be released in low-income countries. These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.howIsVirufyQ":"How is Virufy different from other groups working on similar projects?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.howIsVirufyA":"Because Virufy is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we are able to recruit highly talented professionals as volunteers.

Companies including Slack and JotForm have supported us with free software and cloud credits as COVID responders. Other expenses such as email services and cloud compute have been paid out of the founder Amil’s savings but are only a few thousand dollars.\n\nWe believe that if we are successful, our cloud compute costs will increase, but we will be able to attract ample grant funding and private donations, and thus are thinking to rely solely on that.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.isVirufyAnonProfitQ":"Is Virufy a non-profit?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.isVirufyAnonProfitA":"Virufy is a California nonprofit corporation operating through a fiscal sponsorship with Players Philanthropy Fund, a Maryland charitable trust recognized by IRS as a tax-exempt public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (Federal Tax ID: 27-6601178). Contributions to Virufy are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatAreUniversitiesQ":"What are the participating universities?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatAreUniversitiesA":"Virufy is not officially affiliated with any university.\n\nHowever, we are a Stanford University <a target='_blank' href='https://responselab.stanford.edu/projects.html'>COVID-19 Response Innovation Lab project</a>, have participated in <a target='_blank' href='https://h4r.stanford.edu/'>Stanford’s Hacking</a>   for Recovery startup accelerator, and have also been featured across various <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World platforms</a>.\n\n\nOur team includes students and alumni from more than 25 universities including UC Berkeley, Harvard, and Princeton.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI":"About Artificial Intelligence Algorithm","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whyQ":"Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whyA":"Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detecable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesQ":"How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesA":"By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster. Meanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check-up or test for COVID.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouQ":"How do you measure our percentage of effectiveness, and is this measured in clinical studies?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouA":"Please see <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>https://virufy.org/paper</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/research.html'>https://virufy.org/research.html</a>  for details about our research.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneQ":"Are smartphone microphones reliable enough to be used for detection?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneA":"Yes, the results from 3500 people from 20 countries with many different smartphones show that microphones are indeed able to capture COVID-19 signatures.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceQ":"Will the performance of the AI model in different environments remain unaffected?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceA":"Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions on the app on how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of situations if needed.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatWasQ":"What was the main difficulty in collecting and processing data? Was there any region where artificial intelligence was less accurate, for example?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatWasA":"The process is slow and cumbersome when collecting from hospitals, requiring clinical study forms and IRB approvals. With supervision from Stanford medical advisors, we went through this process for two hospitals in South Asia and are currently in discussions with hospitals in South America and Africa.\nFor collecting directly from users, we spent significant efforts with pro bono expert lawyers to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, including LGPD.\nAs described in our <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>research paper</a>, some of the difficulties we found in processing data included excessive background noises and incorrect cough recordings submitted by users, which required the AI developers to manually clean the audio samples before training AI models.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.hasTecnologyQ":"Has the technology been validated yet?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.hasTecnologyA":"Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19. We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. As outlined in our research paper, we have independently shown that the COVID cough signature generalizes across continents and between clinical and crowdsourced datasets.\n\nWe have already done IRB-approved clinical studies in hospitals in two countries and are currently seeking approvals in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for clinical studies through private hospital executive and top-level governmental connections.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.canAsymptomaticQ":"Can asymptomatic cases be detected?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.canAsymptomaticA":"Yes, asymptomatic detection has been shown in research by MIT and other groups. It is especially important for people in their 20s and 30s who are more likely to be asymptomatic.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willTheAppQ":"Will the application use artificial intelligence developed by third parties or created just for this purpose?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willTheAppA":"Virufy has its own AI research team and is open to collaboration and integration of AI algorithms from other research groups.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansQ":"What are your plans for Virufy after the COVID-19 vaccine?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansA":"We anticipate that low-income countries will not have the financial resources and medical infrastructure to vaccinate their population and that rapid, equitable COVID-19 testing will still be important to control the pandemic, especially in those countries. Additionally, from our discussions with senior vaccine industry experts, it is unclear how effective the new COVID-19 vaccines will be in the long-term and also fear that COVID will remain a seasonal disease similar to other coronaviruses such as the common cold and flu.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansControlQ":"What are your plans for Virufy after COVID-19 is under control?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.whatAreYourPlansControlA":"Virufy aims to bring an end to the spread of various communicable diseases in low-income countries through widespread, smartphone-based testing which can be used whenever a community feels at risk of virus spread. We anticipate that the same artificial intelligence technology can be adapted to detect other coronaviruses, including the common cold and influenza. This can reduce the unnecessary burden on healthcare systems and chemical-based diagnosis for diseases which can be detected by AI.","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances":"About Finances and Donations","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.doIneedQ":"Do I need to make any financial contribution to donate my cough?","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.doIneedA":"No.","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.howDoIQ":"How do I record my cough and submit it to Virufy?","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.howDoIA":"Virufy is currently only collecting coughs from certain countries, which can be found in our app: <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/app'>https://virufy.org/app</a>","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.doIneedToHaveQ":"Do I need to have coughing symptoms to donate my cough?","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.doIneedToHaveA":"No, the app is also compatible with a forced cough.","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.howManyQ":"How many donors have you had in total?","ourApproach.faq.aboutFinances.howManyA":"We have more than 5,000 cough recordings from over 10 countries, mostly in South America and South Asia.
