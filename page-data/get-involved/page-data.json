He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital. The original team of Virufy, beginning with Stanford graduate AI students, expanded to volunteers from universities around the world.\n\nAs a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World Japan</a> ambassador who has travelled to over a dozen countries, Amil understands the global perspective and how a smartphone-based solution can be used by people all over the world.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatWillQ":"What will your organization do?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.whatWillA":"Virufy aims to build the world’s largest dataset of COVID cough sounds by generating a movement where millions of people collectively contribute their data to fight our common enemy, COVID. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit startup free of institutional red tape and with a diverse team across 20 countries, we are well positioned to make this happen.\n\nOnce approved by local public health authorities, smartphone app(s) for rapid, no-cost COVID testing will be released in low-income countries. These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on.","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.howIsVirufyQ":"How is Virufy different from other groups working on similar projects?","ourApproach.faq.aboutVirufy.howIsVirufyA":"Because Virufy is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we are able to recruit highly talented professionals as volunteers.

Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howWillA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesQ":"How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoesA":"By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster. Meanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check-up or test for COVID.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouQ":"How do you measure our percentage of effectiveness, and is this measured in clinical studies?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.howDoYouA":"Please see <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>https://virufy.org/paper</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/research.html'>https://virufy.org/research.html</a>  for details about our research.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneQ":"Are smartphone microphones reliable enough to be used for detection?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.areSmartPhoneA":"Yes, the results from 3500 people from 20 countries with many different smartphones show that microphones are indeed able to capture COVID-19 signatures.","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceQ":"Will the performance of the AI model in different environments remain unaffected?","ourApproach.faq.aboutAI.willPerformanceA":"Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions on the app on how to record their cough.
