For example,research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high acurracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.","index.faq.aiQ":"How will Virufy’s AI algorithm detect COVID-19?","index.faq.aiA":"Based on past research, Virufy is developing an AI algorithm that can be used to accurately predict a COVID-19 infection within minutes based on recordings of cough sounds. However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.","nav.ourApproach":"Our Approach","nav.dashboard":"Dashboard","nav.ourData":"Our Data","nav.our-org":"Our Org","nav.inTheNews":"In the News","nav.getInvolved":"GET INVOLVED","nav.techBehind":"The Technology Behind","nav.openData":"Open Data","nav.faqs":"FAQs","nav.ourVision":"Our Vision","nav.ourSupporters":"Our Supporters","nav.ourTeam":"Our People","news.headers.header":"Virufy as seen in the news","news.headers.filter":"Filter News by Country","news.news.section2.date":"February 2021","news.news.section2.title":"Esta app busca diagnosticar Covid-19 con sólo toser frente al teléfono","news.news.section2.name":"Forbes","news.news.section2.city":" ","news.news.section2.country":" ","news.news.section2.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section3.date":"January 2021","news.news.section3.title":"COVID-19: Aplicativo Virufy puede diagnosticar el virus mediante el análisis de la tos","news.news.section3.name":"MSN","news.news.section3.city":" ","news.news.section3.country":" ","news.news.section3.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section4.date":"October 2020","news.news.section4.title":"VIRUFY: plataforma que permite detectar si estamos contagiados con COVID-19","news.news.section4.name":"Expreso","news.news.section4.city":"Lima, ","news.news.section4.country":"Peru","news.news.section4.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section5.date":"May 2020","news.news.section5.title":"One Young World Japan Ambassador Targets COVID-19 Using A.I.","news.news.section5.name":"One Young World","news.news.section5.city":"Tokyo, ","news.news.section5.country":"Japan","news.news.section5.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section6.date":"2020","news.news.section6.title":"North American Ambassadors on the Frontlines of the COVID-19 Response","news.news.section6.name":"One Young World","news.news.section6.city":" ","news.news.section6.country":" ","news.news.section6.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section7.date":"July 2020","news.news.section7.title":"Ambassadors of the Month July","news.news.section7.name":"One Young World","news.news.section7.city":" ","news.news.section7.country":" ","news.news.section7.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section8.date":"July 2020","news.news.section8.title":"Thousands attend OYW's global digital events in July: A recap of what you've missed","news.news.section8.name":"One Young World","news.news.section8.city":" ","news.news.section8.country":" ","news.news.section8.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section9.date":"2020","news.news.section9.title":"One Young World Tokyo 2020 Caucus","news.news.section9.name":"One Young World","news.news.section9.city":" ","news.news.section9.country":" ","news.news.section9.readMoreLink":"Read more...","news.news.section10.date":"2020","news.news.section10.title":"Virufy Presentation to One Young World Tokyo 2020 Cacus","news.news.section10.name":"One Young World","news.news.section10.city":"Tokyo, ","news.news.section10.country":"Japan","news.news.section10.readMoreLink":"Watch Now","news.news.section11.date":"2020","news.news.section11.title":"Sounds of COVID-19 Workshop","news.news.section11.name":"One Young World","news.news.section11.city":" ","news.news.section11.country":" ","news.news.section11.readMoreLink":"Read more...","ourApproach.topFold.diagnoseDisease":"AI to freely and quickly identify diseases","ourApproach.topFold.acrossNations":"All people across all nations should have fast, affordable access to healthcare.","ourApproach.topFold.usingTechnology":"So we’re using technology to do this.
